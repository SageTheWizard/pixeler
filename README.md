Pixeler is a python script that takes an image as an input and turns it into pixel art<br /> 
USAGE: Execute using "./pixeler [imageFile] [sizeOfPixels]" <br />
sizeOfPixels would be the NxN dimensions of the pixels of the output <br /> 
NOTE:
Allow the file to be executed with "chmod +x pixeler" .. and optionally move the file to /usr/local/bin to use as a normal program<br />
